#### *admin, fun commands and much more!*

[Installation is easy](https://discord.gg/dfdvArY), and you do NOT need to know anything about coding! Aside from installation and updating, every part of the bot can be controlled from within Discord.

But now you can also enjoy the use of my personal selfbot! However, one caveat needs to be established:

> I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE AND CANNOT BE HELD LIABLE IF YOU MESS UP WITH SELFBOTS. THIS INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO LOSING PRIVILEGES, GETTING KICKED OR BANNED FROM SERVERS, OR BEING BANNED.

## Requirements

- `git` command line ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)|[Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)|[MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)) installed
- `node` [Version 8.0.0 or higher](https://nodejs.org)
- `a machine` to host it on. Want it to be online 24/7? Get a VPS.
- `some goddamn sense` If you don't intend to read the rest of this document, you shouldn't bother using this selfbot.
- `some knowledge of node` because I'm not there to handhold you.
 
## Downloading

In a command prompt in your projects folder (wherever that may be) run the following:

`git clone https://github.com/JohnDoesCodes/Myselfbot.git`

Once finished:

- In the folder from where you ran the git command, run `cd Myselfbot` and then run `npm install`
- Edit `config.json` and enter your token and other details as indicated. It should look like this afterwards:

## Getting your login token

1. From either the web application, or the installed Discord app, use the **CTRL+SHIFT+I** keyboard shortcut.
2. This brings up the **Developer Tools**. Go to the **Application** tab
3. On the left, expand **Local Storage**, then click on the discordapp.com entry (it should be the only one).
4. Locate the entry called `token`, and copy it.

> **KEEP YOUR TOKEN SECRET, AND NEVER SHARE IT WITH ANYONE**
